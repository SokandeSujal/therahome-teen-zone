          TheraHome: Teen Zone isn't just another mental wellness app. It's a
          sanctuary created by teens who understand what you're going through,
          for teens who need someone to listen without judgment. We believe that
          healing starts with feeling heard, and sometimes the hardest battles
          are the ones nobody else can see. Whether you're dealing with the
          pressure of school, complicated friendships, family tensions, or just
          trying to figure out who you are in this chaotic world, we're here for
          you. This is your space to breathe, to feel, and to grow at your own
          pace.

        <div class="glass-card about-card">
          <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
          <p class="about-text">
            TheraHome was born from a simple but powerful realization: teens
            need mental health support that actually gets them. Founded by a
            group of high school students who experienced firsthand the
            challenges of navigating adolescent mental health, we knew there had
            to be a better way. We've all been there—sitting in counselor's
            offices that felt too clinical, using apps designed by people who
            haven't been teenagers in decades, or worse, suffering in silence
            because we didn't know where to turn.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            Our founder's journey began during a particularly dark sophomore
            year, when anxiety and depression felt overwhelming and the existing
            resources felt inadequate. After countless nights of journaling,
            meditation attempts, and conversations with friends going through
            similar struggles, the vision for TheraHome became clear. We needed
            a space that combined professional mental health techniques with the
            authentic understanding that only comes from lived experience. A
            place where CBT meets TikTok generation sensibilities, where
            meditation doesn't feel boring, and where it's okay to not be okay.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            Today, TheraHome serves thousands of teens across the country,
            offering evidence-based tools wrapped in an interface that feels
            like home. We're not trying to replace therapy—we're here to bridge
            the gap between struggling alone and seeking professional help.
            Because sometimes, the first step to healing is just having a safe
            place to start.

            TheraMind brings the power of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
            right to your fingertips, but in a way that actually makes sense for

            stressed. That's why TheraMind transforms these proven techniques
            into interactive, engaging exercises that help you understand your
            thoughts and emotions better. It's like having a therapist's toolkit
            in your pocket, ready to help you challenge negative thought
            patterns, process difficult emotions, and build healthier coping
            mechanisms—all at your own pace and in your own words.

              Understanding the mind-body connection through mindful eating.
              TheraNutrition will help you explore how food affects your mood
              without the toxic diet culture. We'll provide recipes for comfort
              foods that nourish, snacks that help with anxiety, and guidance on
              eating intuitively—because taking care of your body is part of
              taking care of your mind.

              Capture and celebrate the small victories that matter.
              TheraMoments will be your private photo journal where you can
              document your journey—the good days, the challenging ones, and
              everything in between. With prompts for gratitude, achievement
              tracking, and visual mood boarding, it's about recognizing that
              healing isn't linear, and every moment of progress counts.
