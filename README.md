# TheraHome: Teen Zone

## Overview
TheraHome: Teen Zone is a mental wellness platform designed by teens, for teens aged 13 to 19. This web-based preview of the TheraHome app offers a safe, judgment-free space to support young people dealing with stress, anxiety, or emotional challenges. With a calming, glassmorphism-inspired UI, the website emphasizes empathy, trust, and accessibility, aligning with the brand’s mission to make mental health resources relatable and approachable for teens. This project was created as part of my brother’s initiative to bring meaningful mental wellness tools to his peers, reflecting his passion for fostering a supportive community.

## Features
The website showcases both functional and upcoming features of the TheraHome: Teen Zone app:

- **TheraBot**: A friendly, Gemini-powered chatbot offering supportive conversations for teens needing to vent or seek advice.
- **TheraMind**: A guided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based tool to help users process thoughts and emotions, powered by Gemini AI.
- **TheraSpace**: A private area for mood tracking, relaxation exercises, affirmations, and creative doodling, also powered by Gemini AI.
- **Upcoming Features**: Planned enhancements like TheraStore, TheraVoices, TheraNutrition, and TheraMoments are highlighted with "Coming Soon" placeholders to build anticipation.

The website includes a modern navigation bar, a hero section with the app’s mission and founder story, and a footer with social media placeholders and a disclaimer noting that TheraHome is not a replacement for professional therapy.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structures the website’s content.
- **CSS**: Implements a glassmorphism-inspired design with soft gradients, blurred backgrounds, and rounded typography for a calming aesthetic.
- **JavaScript**: Powers interactive elements and mock integrations with Google’s Gemini API for AI-driven features.
